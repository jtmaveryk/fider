## üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è How to use

- Click the Railway button üëÜ
- Add the environment variables
  - You can leave the `HOST_DOMAIN` empty when you first deploy the starter. Read the Notes section below for instructions on how to add it.
- The first deployment will fail as we left the `HOST_DOMAIN` environment variable empty. Head over to `/deployments/domains` under your project and copy the production environment domain and add it as an environment variable with `HOST_DOMAIN` as the key.
- Your app should now automagically be redeployed and work as expected.
